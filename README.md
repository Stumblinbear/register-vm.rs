# register-vm.rs

This is just a toy bytecode virtual machine utilizing a register-based (rather than stack-based) architecture, written in Rust.

## Installation

To execute the test cases, clone the repo and run.

```bash
cargo test
```

Running bytecode from a file is possible, however there is yet no compiler for ease of writing these programs.
